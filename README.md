# Project overview

We are a team of crypto-enthusiasts, which worried about the ecological situation on Earth. 

Nowadays around the world, people have a lot of ideas about how to reduce the amount of plastic, how to make goods with eco-materials, how to protect animals etc.

But these solutions have one big problem - these activities do not attract enough people at least because they are mostly voluntary

And we can introduce new solution with the usage of blockchain and cryptocurrency how to attract people to reduce the amount of plastic around the Earth. Itâ€™s similar to **play-to-earn** business model, where people will have a worthy reward for their contribution to cleaning the planet from pollution.

## Main problem

The problem of environmental pollution is becoming more and more urgent every year. Pollution is killing, changing the cycle of the seasons and bringing the possibility of disasters across the world closer. 

So, in the last few years across a lot of countries in Europe and the USA appeared automatic machines which allow you to put plastic bottles inside and receive rewards for recycling. The reward is a certain amount of money which you can spend in the shop or market where machine is located.

### Ok, but what product we are offering?

We have developed an application using NEAR smart-contracts in order to enable enthusiasts and volunteers around the world to receive additional rewards for cleaning the Earth and at the same time popularize cryptocurrencies (in particular NEAR) among a new generation.

A feature and one of the main advantages is that we can use already existing plastic recycling machines by adding just a QR code at the bottom of the check they give you.

By handing over bottles, users receive a cryptocurrency that they can withdraw at the end of the season.

At the same time, we offer gamification including a general table of users, a social rating, as well as multipliers with which users can earn more by moving up in the rating table.

Each season continues for at least a month, and users have the possibility of completing unique seasonal and weekly tasks, by completing which the user can receive either additional coins, social points or other interesting rewards.

### Innovation

We are using blockchain to solve environmental problems, as well as popularizing the crypto industry through socially significant activities. A large number of governments are highly-interested in plastic recycling and our project has a potential chance of getting funding as an initiative to speed up and improve this process.
